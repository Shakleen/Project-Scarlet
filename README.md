# Project Scarlet
A mobile prodctivity application that aims to encourage people to be more productive by making productivity more fun and easy to measure.

## Project Information
**Application Type**: Productivity application, game  
**Target Platform**: Mobile (both Android and iOS)  

## Motivation
The main target of this app is to make productivity tangible to the user. Measuring productive is hard as it consists just of completing everyday tasks. So most people find it difficult to be productive and slacks of doing things that matter. This application aims to change that mindset and make productivity fun by incorporating a game along with it.  

## Main Idea
The user will be able to measure the productivity across 3 different regions which are mainly:  
1. **Exercising (Strength)**: Measure the amount of exercise done. Get exercise data from google fit.  
2. **Studying (Wisdom)**: The user will be able to store, review and quiz using flash cards.  
3. **Restraining from excessive phone usage (Resistance)**: Measure and reduce the amount of time spent on applications.  
Each region will award or penalize the user with tokens depending on the amount of productive workload the user has successfully completed. The user can use these tokens to play and advance in a mobile game.
